* init

  - set modes
  - send 1 to SSpin
  - set SPI, Master and f_osc/128 at SPCR
  - clear SPI2X at SPSR
  - spiSend 0xFF 10 times (supply 74 clock cycles with CS high)
  - CS low
  - Send CMD0,0 with cardCommand. Repeat until R1 is 0x01 
    
  Continues with more.

* cardCommand

  - end partial block read. Use readEnd
  - CS low
  - wait until SD card is not busy. Use waitNotBusy
  - spiSend the command | 0x40
  - Send arguments with spiSend
  - send CRC with spiSend
    - for CMD0, crc = 0x95
    - for CMD8, crc = 0x87
    - else, crc = 0xFF
  - Wait for response with spiRec & 0x80
      
* spiSend
  - Set SPDR with byte
  - Wait until not SPSR & (1<<SPIF)
 
* spiRec
  - Send 0xFF
  - Return SPDR contents.

* waitNotBusy
  wait until spiRec() is 0xFF
